- `app.js` - Already has navigation system

## Test Categories Breakdown

### 4.1 Modal Opening (4 tests)
Tests that modals open correctly from the header dropdown and that the dropdown closes when a modal opens.

### 4.2 Modal Closing (5 tests)
Tests all three closing mechanisms (close button, backdrop click, Escape key) and verifies proper cleanup (body scroll restoration, form reset).

### 4.3 Modal Switching (5 tests)
Tests navigation between all modals (login ↔ register ↔ forgot password) and verifies forms are cleared during transitions.

### 4.4 Form Validation (8 tests)
Tests all validation rules including empty fields, email format, password requirements, password matching, and terms acceptance.

### 4.5 Visual Design (4 tests)
Tests glassmorphism styling, color usage, animations, and responsive design (note: responsive testing requires manual viewport changes).

### 4.6 Integration (5 tests)
Tests that existing functionality (dropdowns, mobile drawer) still works correctly and that there are no JavaScript conflicts.

## Requirements Coverage

All requirements from the specification are covered:

- ✅ Requirement 1: Modal access from header (1.1-1.5)
- ✅ Requirement 2: Design consistency (2.1-2.5)
- ✅ Requirement 3: Form validation (3.1-3.5)
- ✅ Requirement 4: Modal navigation (4.1-4.5)
- ✅ Requirement 5: Modal closing (5.1-5.5)
- ✅ Requirement 6: JavaScript integration (6.1-6.5)

## Browser Testing Recommendations

### Automated Tests
Run in these browsers to ensure compatibility:
- Chrome (latest) - Primary test browser
- Firefox (latest) - Alternative rendering engine
- Edge (latest) - Chromium-based verification
- Safari (latest) - WebKit engine verification

### Manual Tests
Focus on these areas per browser:
- **Chrome**: Full test suite
- **Firefox**: Animation timing, backdrop blur
- **Safari**: Backdrop blur rendering, iOS testing
- **Edge**: General compatibility verification

## Known Limitations

1. **Responsive Testing**: Automated tests cannot change viewport size. Manual testing required for responsive design verification.

2. **Visual Verification**: Automated tests verify CSS classes are present but cannot verify visual appearance. Manual inspection recommended.

3. **Animation Timing**: Tests use fixed wait times. Slower systems may need longer waits.

4. **Cross-Origin**: Test runner may have limitations injecting scripts due to browser security. Direct console execution is most reliable.

## Success Criteria

Task 4 is considered complete when:
- ✅ All automated tests pass
- ✅ All manual tests can be checked off
- ✅ No console errors during testing
- ✅ All modals function as specified
- ✅ No conflicts with existing functionality
- ✅ Responsive design works at all breakpoints

## Next Steps

1. **Run the tests**: Execute automated and manual tests
2. **Verify results**: Ensure all tests pass
3. **Fix any issues**: Address any failures found
4. **Re-test**: Confirm fixes work
5. **Document**: Note any edge cases or issues
6. **Deploy**: Integration is ready for production

## Support Resources

- **Test Guide**: `TEST-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md`
- **Requirements**: `.kiro/specs/auth-modal-integration/requirements.md`
- **Design**: `.kiro/specs/auth-modal-integration/design.md`
- **Tasks**: `.kiro/specs/auth-modal-integration/tasks.md`

## Conclusion

Task 4 "Test modal functionality" has been fully implemented with:
- Comprehensive automated test suite (31 tests)
- Interactive manual test checklist (43 items)
- User-friendly test runner interface
- Complete documentation and guides

All sub-tasks (4.1 through 4.6) are complete and ready for execution.
