# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates the authentication modals (login, register, and forgot password) from the standalone `authRegister.html` page into the main `index.html` page. The integration will allow users to access authentication functionality directly from the main page's header dropdown without navigating to a separate page, while maintaining the existing design language and user experience.

## Glossary

- **Main Page**: The `index.html` file that serves as the primary landing page
- **Auth Modals**: The login, register, and forgot password modal dialogs
- **Header Dropdown**: The account dropdown menu in the navigation header
- **Auth Tabs**: The "Giriş Yap" (Login) and "Kayıt Ol" (Register) tab buttons in the account dropdown
- **Modal System**: The overlay-based dialog system for authentication forms
- **Validation System**: Client-side form validation with error messages
